# TODO

1. [ ] Generate a SPEC to migrate this UI, which is currently a catppuccin mocha theme, to be more like [open-sea](https://opensea.io/), and to use three.js, modern webGL shaders, and gsap. Do not delete the existing theme, just migrate it towards deprecation through this spec
2. [ ] Fix bugs with DeckDetailPage
3. [ ] Page by Page Audit
